Misc Content points to possibly add
  * unit testing
  * effective node app are many small specialized apps, not a single large app
  * many small requests vs less large ones
  * the event loop is always running
  * streams
  * speed (req/sec)
  * answer “why should I care about node”
  * discuss wide range of uses
    * websites, apps, api’s, cli tools, etc




Demo App Ideas
  * basic chatroom
    # socket.io
  * shared app
    # drawing?
    # fish tank?
  * max game
  * CLI app
    # read file
    # send request through API
    # streams?
    # use JS lib that would normally be used client side
